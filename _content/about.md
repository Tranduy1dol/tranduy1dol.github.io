I transmute complex ideas into elegant, high-performance software.
With deep expertise in Rust, distributed systems, and cryptography,
I craft backend architectures that are both powerful and secure.

## Background

I'm a passionate Rust Backend Developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science 
and Cryptography from the University of Engineering and Technology (VNU). 

Currently working at Sotatek, I design and implement high-performance RESTful APIs 
using Axum and Actix, engineer scalable messaging systems with Kafka and RabbitMQ, 
and optimize database performance with Redis caching and SeaOrm.

My blockchain work includes developing Starknet Layer 2 solutions integrated with 
Aptos Layer 1, complete with Rust-based provers for on-chain verification. I also 
research and implement Zero-Knowledge Proof algorithms, including zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs.

When I'm not writing Rust, I'm exploring cryptographic primitives, building 
developer tools, or diving deep into distributed systems architecture.

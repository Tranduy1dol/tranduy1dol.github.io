## My Review

This book is a must-read for any software developer who wants to level up their craft. Thomas and Hunt present timeless principles that apply regardless of the programming language or technology stack you work with.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

### 2. Orthogonality
Design components that are self-contained, independent, and have a single, well-defined purpose.

### 3. Tracer Bullets
Use tracer bullets to find the target by building thin slices of functionality end-to-end.

### 4. Automation
Automate everything you can. Scripts are documentation that actually works.

## Who Should Read This

- Junior developers looking to build a solid foundation
- Senior developers who want to refine their practices
- Tech leads who need to mentor others

## Final Thoughts

The book remains relevant even decades after its first publication. The principles are technology-agnostic and focus on the mindset of a professional programmer.

## My Review

Martin Kleppmann has written the definitive guide to building reliable, scalable, and maintainable data systems. This book bridges the gap between theory and practice in a way that few technical books manage.

## Key Takeaways

### Data Models and Query Languages
Understanding the trade-offs between relational, document, and graph databases is crucial for making good architectural decisions.

### Storage and Retrieval
The internals of how databases store and retrieve data directly impact performance. Understanding B-trees, LSM-trees, and column storage helps you choose the right tool.

### Encoding and Evolution
Schema evolution is inevitable. Design your systems to handle change gracefully.

### Replication and Partitioning
Distributed systems are complex. Understanding the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance is essential.

## Who Should Read This

- Backend engineers working with databases
- System architects designing distributed systems
- Anyone building data pipelines

## Final Thoughts

This is not a light read, but it's incredibly valuable. I keep returning to it as a reference.

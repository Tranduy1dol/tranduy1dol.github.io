## My Review

Clean Code is a classic that every developer should read at least once. While some examples feel dated, the core principles remain relevant.

## Key Takeaways

### Meaningful Names
Names should reveal intent. A good name makes code self-documenting.

### Functions Should Be Small
Functions should do one thing and do it well. If a function does multiple things, break it apart.

### Comments Are a Last Resort
Code should be clear enough that comments are rarely needed. When you need a comment, ask if you can refactor instead.

### Error Handling
Don't use return codes. Throw exceptions. Handle errors gracefully.

## Critiques

Some of the Java examples feel verbose by modern standards. The advice is sometimes taken too literally by readers, leading to over-engineering.

## Final Thoughts

Read it with a critical eye. Take the principles, but adapt them to your context.
